## ‚≠ê Getting started

The code in [`mod.ts`](./mod.ts) fetches your RescueTime daily statistics and posts it on Slack using a webhook configured in [`rescuetime-slack.yml`](./rescuetime-slack.yml):

```yml
webhook: https://hooks.slack.com/services/$WEBHOOK
apiKeys:
  "Anand Chowdhary": "$API_KEY"
```

More people can be added under the `apiKeys` key in the YAML file. For each user, `$API_KEY` is replaced by the API key for their name, stored in GitHub Secrets; for example "Anand Chowdhary" transforms to `API_KEY_ANAND_CHOWDHARY`. The `$WEBHOOK` environment variable has the Slack webhook.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Automation

A GitHub Actions [workflow](./.github/workflows/deno.yml) runs the following script every alternate day to update this repo:

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-write --allow-read --allow-env --unstable mod.ts
```
